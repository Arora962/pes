# Peer Evaluation System

Peer Evaluation System is an open-source web application currently in development, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Our goal is to simplify and enhance the peer evaluation process for academic courses through a modern, user-friendly platform.

Before running, make sure to add a .env file in the backend folder and add define the MONGO_URI environment variable in it.
Backend runs at port 5000 and, frontend runs at port 5173.
